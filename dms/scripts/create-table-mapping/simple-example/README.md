## Create simple selection table mapping rules to use with DMS task
1. Create a CSV file with columns `schema` and `table`. Add a row for each schema and table you want to replicate from a source database. Recommended location for this file is `terraform_aws/dms/{env_name}/{module-instantiation}/table-mappings/{table-mapping-name}.csv`.
2. To create the simple selection rules for these tables, run `python create_mapping.py [input_path] [output_path]` from this directory. `input_path` is the path to the CSV file you created. The JSON table mapping rules will be generated to `output_path`. Reccomended output path is `terraform_aws/dms/{env_name}/{module-instantiation}/table-mappings/{table-mapping-name}.json`
3. In the instantiation of the dms-replication module, set `replication_task_table_mappings` for your database in the databases variable to the `{table-mapping-name}.json` settings you generated. See README in `modules/aws/dms-replication` for more information on the databases variable and options within it.
